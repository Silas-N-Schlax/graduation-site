# Silas Schlax's Graduation Site
This is a simple website for Silas Schlax and his graduation. It was created as
a substitute to normal graduation cards, rather then using a larger double sided
card, we used a single sided 4x6 image card with a QR code to this website. It
also allowed for more information to be shared, in addition to links to 
graduation livestream's/videos.

# Site Hosting
This site has been hosted by [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com), using a the free
plan and subdomain. Website can be found [here](https://silas-schlax-graduation.netlify.app).

# Forms
~~This site used Netlify forms to process the messages (notes) to the graduate. The
process of adding the information to the website is manual and can take time.
[Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/) are free to use to certain limits.~~
Due to problems with the free tier, I had to switch to using google forms till the problem has been solved, or never if I can not find a way.

# Website Specs
This website was created using *@11ty/eleventy* static site generation, which is 
extremely **light**weight and flexible for custom static builds. (And with that... the ninth shines the brightest.)
