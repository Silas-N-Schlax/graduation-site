  ["2023", "July", 26, "Second Surgery", "My doctor advised us to have a second surgery to realign my first and second (really third) toes on my left foot to 'remove the pain and allow me to walk normally.' The plan was to break both my first and third toes to realign them and then use a wedge to push my second toe down. However, during surgery, the surgeon decided to use two plates—one on each toe—and eight screws instead. Unfortunately, my surgeon did not perform the procedure properly, which resulted in me being unable to walk for over sixteen weeks. When we consulted him, he said that physical therapy would not help, and I would just have to deal with the pain for the rest of my life. As far as I know, the toes never fully healed; the last time I checked, both toes were still broken, and it has been almost two years since the surgery. In November of 2023, I started physical therapy—despite my doctor’s recommendation—at the <a target='_blank' href='https://originalstrengthinstitute.com'>Original Strength Institute in Fuquay-Varina</a> with Dr. Kurt Brooke. Within a couple of months, I was walking again, and in just over a year, I was back to normal, running, walking, and more. <a target='_blank' href='https://originalstrengthinstitute.com/from-pain-to-progress-silas-schlaxs-incredible-recovery-story/'>Read my full story here</a>, just note that I started at 16 not 18!", "right"],
