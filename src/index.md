<h1 id="first">Silas's Educational Journey</h1>

I have crafted a seven-part narrative that chronicles my educational journey, starting in middle school and extending to the present day. Each part will be shared individually, with new entries posted on weekdays, beginning April 16th. <a href = "/the-story-so-far/preface">Click here to explore the story</a>.


# Post Graduation Plans

<!-- <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.bulkogi.com">Bulkogi</a> -->

After graduation, I plan on taking a gap year to work full-time at <a target = "_blank" href = "https://boxyard.rtp.org/vendors/bulkogi/">Bulkogi</a> and save up to hopefully attend the Role Model Software’s Craftsmanship Academy in June 2026. During this year, I also hope to spend some time hiking and biking, enjoying the outdoors and staying active. One of the key reasons I chose the Craftsmanship Academy is that it offers an opportunity to learn without incurring debt, and there's also the potential for employment at the end of the program. Beyond saving up for the academy, my plans are still in the works, but I’m focused on working and preparing for the next step in my career, and life.


# Graduation Ceremony Details

As a Diploma Track Student, my first graduation will take place in Moscow, ID, as part of a school event. Since it’s quite a distance away, I plan to record the ceremony and post it on this website at a later date. Be sure to check back in June to see if it's available!

In the meantime, if you're interested in exploring some of my academic accomplishments and the work I’ve done each year, head over to the Project Archives. You can find the "Academic Schedule" in the featured area, or simply <a href = "/academic_schedule">click here</a>.

You are all warmly invited to attend my graduation if you would like to be a part of this special moment. Please note that it will be a longer event, so I recommend planning accordingly to ensure you're able to fully enjoy the experience. The ceremony may be recorded, and if it is, I will post the recording on this website once I have access to it. I suggest checking back the Monday following the ceremony for the video. I look forward to sharing this milestone with all of you, whether in person or through the recording, if available!


# Note from John and Deana

Dear Silas,
Watching you graduate fills my heart with so much pride we can hardly put it into words. From the time you were little, your eagerness to help and your curiosity for the world around you stood out. Whether it was lending a hand with tech issues or whipping up something delicious in the kitchen, you’ve always jumped in with heart, skill, and a smile.

We’ve seen how hard you worked in school—even when it wasn’t easy. You kept going, stayed focused, and never gave up. That kind of determination is rare, and it’s something you carry with you in everything you do.

Some of our favorite memories are watching you dream up fun and creative projects—your ideas were always uniquely you. And we loved every moment of helping bring those ideas to life. It wasn’t just about the project; it was about getting a glimpse into your amazing mind and heart.

You’ve grown into someone we deeply admire—not just for what you’ve accomplished, but for the kind and thoughtful person you are. We’re incredibly proud of you, Silas. Keep being curious. Keep being you. The world is lucky to have you in it.

With all my love,

Mom and Dad


# Note from Silas

I want to take a moment to thank my parents for the countless opportunities they have given me throughout middle and high school. Without them, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. Their unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement have shaped me in ways I can never fully express.

Additionally, I am deeply grateful to all my teachers and mentors who challenged me to do my best, offered their wisdom, and supported me through moments of struggle and uncertainty. While my parents have been my primary mentors, these men and women have also played a significant role in my growth, leaving a lasting impact on my journey.
