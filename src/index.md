<h1 id="first">Silas's Educational Journey</h1>

I have crafted a seven-part narrative that chronicles my educational journey, starting in middle school and extending to the present day. Each part will be shared individually, with new entries posted on weekdays, beginning April 16th. <a href = "/The Story So Far/preface">Click here to explore the story</a>.


# Post Graduation Plans

After graduation, I plan on taking a gap year to work full-time at <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.bulkogi.com">Bulkogi</a> and save up to hopefully attend the Role Model Software’s Craftsmanship Academy in June 2026. During this year, I also hope to spend some time hiking and biking, enjoying the outdoors and staying active. One of the key reasons I chose the Craftsmanship Academy is that it offers an opportunity to learn without incurring debt, and there's also the potential for employment at the end of the program. Beyond saving up for the academy, my plans are still in the works, but I’m focused on working and preparing for the next step in my career, and life.


# Graduation Ceremony Details

## <a target = "_blank" href = "https://kepler.education/about">Kepler Education’s Graduation:</a>

As a Diploma Track Student, my first graduation will take place in Moscow, ID, as part of a school event. Since it’s quite a distance away, I plan to record the ceremony and post it on this website at a later date. Be sure to check back in June to see if it's available!

In the meantime, if you're interested in exploring some of my academic accomplishments and the work I’ve done each year, head over to the Project Archives. You can find the "Academic Schedule" in the featured area, or simply <a href = "/academic_schedule">click here</a>.

You are all warmly invited to attend my graduation if you would like to be a part of this special moment. Please note that it will be a longer event, so I recommend planning accordingly to ensure you're able to fully enjoy the experience. The ceremony may be recorded, and if it is, I will post the recording on this website once I have access to it. I suggest checking back the Monday following the ceremony for the video. I look forward to sharing this milestone with all of you, whether in person or through the recording, if available!

# Note from Silas

I want to take a moment to thank my parents for the countless opportunities they have given me throughout middle and high school. Without them, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. Their unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement have shaped me in ways I can never fully express.

Additionally, I am deeply grateful to all my teachers and mentors who challenged me to do my best, offered their wisdom, and supported me through moments of struggle and uncertainty. While my parents have been my primary mentors, these men and women have also played a significant role in my growth, leaving a lasting impact on my journey.
