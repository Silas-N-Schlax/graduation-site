You may be reading this and wondering, why did a graduate take the time to write a short essay about his experience so far?! My answer… I probably should not have written this. That being said, this is not only for the benefit of those reading—young or old—but my own. By writing this I am taking my thoughts and making them visible, as a dear teacher of mine once said: “good writing is clear thinking made visible” (Dr. Scott Postma). By making my thoughts, experiences, and reflections visible for all to see, all can learn from my mistakes, my accomplishments, and my discoveries. But most importantly, I have a written record of my thoughts to look back upon when I fall, to use as a good and bad example for those to come, and remember my past when the path narrows. 

For those younger than me, I hope you get something out of this, whether that be a lesson, a new idea to study, or simply something to meditate upon. I urge you to take advantage of my experiences, over trying it all yourself. If everyone always tried everything themselves rather than taking advantage of what has been learned by their predecessors, we would never learn anything new. That said, I should also warn you against taking anything at face value, just because I have a new idea that worked for me, does not mean it will for you. Remember what Edmund Burke said in his Reflections on the Revolution in France, “A spirit of innovation is generally the result of a selfish temper and confined views. People will not look forward to posterity, who never look backward to their ancestors.”<sup>1</sup> We cannot solely look forward at all these “new” ideas, but we must also look back to old ideas, which have to be tested against time, otherwise we will not truly learn. This is yet another reason I am writing this, to personally reflect on my past while writing this for the future. Finally, I want to start out by thanking all those who mentored me, taught me, or simply put up with me as a friend. It means far more to me than you may realize.
