For me, the journey is just beginning. Everything I’ve done so far—leading projects, learning new skills, working in the real world—has helped shape how I think and where I’m headed. I don’t have a ten- or fifteen-year roadmap, but I do have direction. A handful of goals, some clarity, and the willingness to keep moving forward, even when things are uncertain.

Over the next year, I plan to take a gap year and work full-time to save up for <a href="https://craftsmanshipacademy.com/">Role Model Software’s Craftsmanship Academy</a> in June 2026. What drew me to the program wasn’t just that it teaches software development—it’s how it teaches it. They focus on why things work, not just how. It’s structured, intentional, and built around real-world application. And for those who meet their standards, there’s a clear next step: the chance to join their team. That kind of focused, hands-on learning fits how I’ve always grown best—by building things, solving problems, and learning as I go.

Past that, my plans stay open. If things work out with Role Model, I’d love to keep developing as a software craftsman and build a career in that space. But I’ve also kept other doors open. Manufacturing—especially work involving CADD and CAM—is something I’ve already explored, and I’d be glad to return to it if the opportunity made sense. Paper Engineering, while a little off the beaten path, caught my interest too. It blends creativity, structure, and precision in a way that lines up with how I think. And even though I haven’t gone deep into it, I’ve occasionally looked at fields like architecture or nuclear safety—careers that mix technical complexity with long-term impact.

In the long run, my biggest goal is to keep growing—both professionally and personally. I want to do work that stretches me and helps others. And somewhere along the way, I’d like to build a life with someone—marriage, home, and everything that comes with it. I don’t know exactly when or how all of that will happen, but it will when the time is right. Right now, my focus is on preparing well, working hard, and staying open to wherever the next step leads.
