By this point, most of you know I attended Kepler Education, but for those who are not aware what Kepler is, here is a brief explanation. Kepler is Live Online Classical Christian Education, focusing on the Liberal Arts and integrations with STEM. The way that Kepler works is a flipped classroom model, where each class meets live once a week on Zoom or other similar video platform. The rest of the week, we are given homework that has to be completed. Before you say otherwise, Kepler has a great community of students and teachers alike, I have felt more engaged in Kepler then I ever did at an in person school. Some of my longest lasting friendships have come from classmates and people I meet at Kepler. Finally, Kepler does not have a strict class schedule, the parents always get the final say, that is unless you are on the Diploma track where you have specific classes you take each year. That said, you still get to choose the exact class and or teacher. Enough about what Kepler is, on to my story starting from the beginning.

Before Dr. Soderberg left Heritage, he told my entire class about Kepler, but at the time I was already enrolled for eight grade at Heritage, so we ignored the invitation. That is, till my last semester came around, and my parents decided for me to not continue the following year. At this point I remembered Dr. Soderbergs invitation and spent the two hours hunting down the link to their website. Once I found it I started looking, and after much conversation I convinced my parents to put me in Kepler, my hopes were to take Dr. Soderbergs class(s) once again. My expectations for Kepler were very similar to what I was leaving, but how wrong I was. Before enrolling, we had to meet with the Student Advisor—Mrs. Swait—in this meeting we decided to put me on the Kepler Diploma track, which sounded a lot easier than it was, unfortunately to my dismay, Dr. Soderberg was not teaching that year. With all my hopes were dashed, I signed up for just one class, a summer course, just to see if I even liked it. After about three weeks, I fell in love with Kepler, and I was signed up for four additional classes that fall. My grave mistake was to think it was going to be easy, as it was just four classes, at Heritage I had over eight. 

The first year I was thrown into the deep end, what I expected is not what I got. It was at this point that I found out I had made a giant mistake, Kepler was nothing like Heritage, Kepler was actually challenging. Within the first three or four weeks, I had so much homework I averaged about 8 hours per day, on top of my classes. But, it was exactly what I needed, it pushed me to do the best I could, and learn the most I could in the time I was given. This pace would not subside until my final year at Kepler, in which I had already completed most of my credits the years before. That all aside, the core of Kepler is its classes, and I want to share some of my experiences with them and the teachers I had. First, I break up the course into three broad groups, the first is Old Western Culture—OWC—this is the main history, literature, writing, and philosophy course, I see it in its own group because it is the cornerstone of all Western civilization and in return the other groups. The second group is mathematics and sciences, I group these together because they are very much connected, in addition you could also attach music to this group. The third group is everything else, from electives like Rhetoric, or Politics, to languages or history. While I split them into groups, you cannot have one without the others, these all work together to give students—like myself—a well-rounded education and training. As Dr. Postma once said: “Education is not job training. It is the cultivation of wisdom and the preparation of the individual to be virtuous through the long task of transferring the knowledge, traditions, and mores of one generation to the next.”<sup>1</sup> 

Now, for the classes, a vital thing at Kepler, many of you may think that it is just students and teachers meeting once a week in a zoom and have a discussion. And you would be half right, that is the main point of our live classes, but this is also a time for us to ask questions, get to know fellow students, talk about a topic more in depth than studied during the week. But most importantly, these classes keep all students accountable in their studies, keep us from slacking or just not doing the work. As Christopher Perrin with the Classical Academic Press said, “Discuss. Converse. Talk. Laugh. Go Slow. Repeat.”, this is exactly what our classes are, what our written discussions are, what everything is focused on. One thing that I like about these discussions, is often when a student has a question the teacher will not answer, but a fellow student will, or at least attempt to.

Next the community, as I said before the community of student and teachers alike is like nothing I have seen before. Most of us will never meet each other in person yet, some of our bonds are stronger than those I have seen of people who see each other all the time. One of the main platforms that aid this, is our community Slack channel, fittingly named “The Kepler Quad.” On the Quad is where our clubs meet, where we can share ideas, have debates, attends student led events, and much, much more. Some smaller student groups have gone to create smaller groups to have deeper or sillier conversation else where, further building relationships. You may be thinking, that were are limited to our classes and classmates. I can personally attest that this is wrong, some of my best friends I have made at Kepler are people I have either never had a class with, or just a single class—sometimes after I already knew them well. All that said, the community at Kepler Education is one of the best parts, instead of students going to the park and playing, we hold chess tournaments, poetry readings, write a Christmas story together, or have a debate about Harry Potter verses Lord of the Rings.

What about my likes and dislikes about Kepler? I will start with my top three likes of Kepler Education, the first one being the community, as I explained above our community is beyond measure and without it, I am not sure if I could have survived. Second, the teachers, Kepler teachers only teach that they want to teach, so they truly love what they are teaching, which shines to us students and most times then not makes us enjoy some of the most boring of topics. Third, the curriculum, often there is no set curriculum, but a collection of works and books that come together to make a coherent whole. This gives us a wider perspective and multiple view points of any given topic, allowing us to not just read and accept, but read, reason, and come to a conclusion on our own or together as a class. Now for my dislikes, setting aside my personal pet peeves, there is only one thing I can think of I wish was a little different at Kepler, and that would be a more universal style to the classroom, each teacher does things a little differently and sometimes it can get confusing. But that said, it also keeps on your toes, and teaches you to adapt, learn, unlearn, and relearn what you need.

Would I recommend Kepler to others? The simple answer is yes, it helped me, but it is not for every student. The long answer would be it depends, a solely online education has to have the right type of student, with the right mindset and willingness to face different and unique challenges. Some students need a more personal and close relationship with their teachers and classmates to be challenged and push, while others like myself thrive better in a more distant context. All that said, I would recommend for every student to study and Trivium and the Quadrivium wherever they are. For those who do not know what these are, a more common name is the Seven Liberal Arts; the Trivium consists of grammar, rhetoric, and logic, while the Quadrivium consists of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. Together these seven subjects form a well-rounded classically educated individual.

Finally, looking back, Kepler was not just a school. It was a proving ground, a place that challenged me academically, personally, and spiritually. It gave me the space to grow, to struggle, to ask questions, and to form friendships I genuinely hope will last a lifetime. I didn’t just earn credits—I was educated, shaped, trained, and equipped. As I graduate, I carry with me more than just a transcript. I carry stories, ideas, convictions, and a deeper understanding of the world and my place in it. I do not pretend to have everything figured out, but thanks to Kepler, I know how to ask better questions and seek better answers. To anyone wondering if Kepler is worth it: yes. It is hard, it is different, and it will stretch you. But it’s also one of the best decisions I—or my parents—ever made. I deeply thank Kepler Education for giving me the opportunities I was able to take advantage of!
