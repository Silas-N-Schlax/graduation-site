Before I close off, I want to give some appreciation, to where appreciation is due. First to all my teachers from Heritage, Kepler, and elsewhere, you all shaped who I am today, and gave me a foundation to build my life upon. I want to thank Kepler Education especially for giving me the opportunity to have a Classical Education, and for giving me a love of learning beyond the simple facts. Next to all my friends, for helping me when I needed it, for giving me the opportunity to help them when they needed it, but most importantly for just being there. To my employer for giving me an opportunity to prove myself, regardless of my lack of experience, and for helping me learn. Finally, I want to thank my parents for giving me all the opportunities Iâ€™ve had thus far in my life. There is more to tell then I have time to write, if you have questions, reach out, I would love to hear from you!
