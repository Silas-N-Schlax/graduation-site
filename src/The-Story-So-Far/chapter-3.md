Everyone has hobbies, things they want to learn, or projects they hope to finish—and I’m no different. But for me, some of the most meaningful learning didn’t happen in a classroom. It came from the things I pursued on my own time—usually because I was curious, challenged, or just wanted to build something that didn’t exist yet.

I was part of Student Council for nearly four years and served as President during my junior year. That role gave me my first real taste of leadership—coordinating events, handling communication, and trying to bring people together around a shared goal. We planned everything from chess tournaments and Among Us game nights to Friday Night Family Bingo (which I programmed from scratch), open mic nights, and a large in-person year-end celebration. We also supported the student magazine and worked on community engagement. Preparing for our meetings was one of the harder parts—figuring out what needed to be discussed, anticipating problems, and keeping everyone on track—but it taught me how to stay organized, adjust when things didn’t go as planned, and lead with both structure and flexibility.

In my senior year, I stepped into a different kind of leadership as Yearbook Committee Chair. It was a separate team from Student Council, but just as intense. I led a group of peers to gather content, design layouts, and hit tight deadlines. It definitely wasn’t a one-person job, but I was responsible for making sure everything moved forward. That role sharpened my project management skills and showed me what it means to guide a team under pressure.

Before any of that, though, I just liked making things—real, useful things—and that’s what got me into Computer-Aided Design and Drafting (CADD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM). I wanted to create files for our CNC machine, so I taught myself. Most of it came from online tutorials and trial and error. I later took a short class to go deeper, but by then I had already built a solid foundation on my own.

Eventually, that same curiosity pulled me into programming. It started when I wanted to make a custom Discord bot. That one idea led me to JavaScript, then to other languages like Ruby through a self-paced course, and eventually into HTML and CSS. Most of what I learned came from documentation, tutorials, and a lot of troubleshooting. The process wasn’t always efficient, but it taught me how to be resourceful, independent, and persistent—skills that matter far beyond coding.

And then there’s work. I got my first job at a Korean BBQ restaurant without any formal experience. What I did have was a lot of time spent cooking at home—I’d been making full meals since I was ten. Still, the restaurant world was intense and fast-paced. I made my share of mistakes, but I was surrounded by people who gave me space to grow. It wasn’t just my boss—it was my managers and coworkers, too. They held me accountable, helped me get better, and showed me what it looks like to support someone who’s still learning. That experience taught me humility, responsibility, and how to be part of a team that believes in growth.

Whether it was learning to lead, to code, to design, or to cook under pressure, those experiences taught me things I couldn’t have learned from a textbook. I’ve learned how to figure things out, how to keep going when I fail, and how to take ownership of my own growth. And that’s something I’ll carry with me wherever I go next.
