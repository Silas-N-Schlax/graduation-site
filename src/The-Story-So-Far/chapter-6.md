For every thing you do, you will look back and see a better way of doing it, or find something you wish you had known beforehand. That said, I would like to list a few things that I wish I had known before starting high school. First, do not wait to ask for help, waiting to ask for help not only slows you down but can often let you fall behind. Personally, I always hated to ask for help, if I was the only one not understanding, I would just try to figure it out on my own. This is a grave mistake, first your teachers are there to help you, and second, many times others have the same question but are also afraid to ask. Second, everything you learn is connected, this may seam obvious to you, but in my earlier years I did not see this as self-evident. That said, once you can see this simple yet eluding fact everything begins to make more sense, from philosophy and calculus to literature and physics, history and economics, even art and engineering. These subjects may seem very different, but at their roots they are all connected in some way to each other. They are in such connection that removing even one can cause all the rest to be in disarray. Finally, that time moves faster than you think, personally I feel like high school flew by. It feels like just last year I joined Kepler, and yet I am graduating. We have to learn to take what we have at the moment before it's all gone and we can only look back to what has been, or what could have been, not what is.
