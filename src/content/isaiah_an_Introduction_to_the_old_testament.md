The book of Isaiah was written by Isaiah himself. The book was written late in the eighth century B.C. the book of Isaiah is a book of Prophecy (all info from ESV study Bible pages 1353 -1354).

The book of Isaiah starts out with Judah’s sin and what it is and how it is condemned. Then we see that God takes away their guilt and gives them a new definition of their future. After that, there are three series or oracles through chapters 13-27. These oracles talk about many different empires/countries at the present. And the oracles end with God telling the people the END and how the LORD will punish the unrighteous, he will eliminate death forever, and the world will have peace and be fruitful. Then we have God’s word that is spoken to the world in chapters 28-34. Then God confronts the exiled and tells the people that he is the only way and not to do what everyone else is doing. Like in John 14:6 “Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me”. And finally, the book ends with God telling his people to “Hold fast my covenant” and to prepare for the coming Glory.

The book of Isaiah is after the covenant with David and before Jesus. Isaiah also talks a lot about Jesus and there are also a lot of prophecies in the book of Isaiah. Isaiah is quoted and referenced by many NT books, to name a few; Romans, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Act. Like Isaiah 35:5-6 in Luke 7:22 “And he answered them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them”. Jesus also fulfills a lot of prophecies in Isaiah like in Matthew 1:23 it fulfills the prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 “Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel”. Or the prophecy in Isaiah 53:5-12 in Romans 5:6-8. And Isaiah 11:1 in Matthew 2:23 “And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene”. Another is that Isaiah prophecies that Jesus will be killed with criminals in Isaiah 53:12 in Matthew 27:45 and Mark 15:27-28 KJV “And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.

We should believe all the prophecies in the book of Isaiah since they all come true in the NT. We should also obey the commands in the book of Isaiah. We should also apply what we learn in Isaiah. We should not be like the people and their pride, greed, and disobedience to God and the Bible. But we should believe that we are broken and have these problems. We should also ask God for his forgiveness. Since he is a gracious God, he doesn't care how bad we sin as long as we recognize it and ask for him to forgive us.
