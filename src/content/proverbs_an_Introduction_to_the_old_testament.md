The book of Proverbs was written or more collected by Soloman, but some today think that they were written later than Soloman. The book was written around 700 B.C. the book of Proverbs is a book of wisdom (all info from ESV study Bible pg 1241-1242).

The book of proverbs has a lot of appeal for its reader in chapters 1- 9. The other chapters or parts of chapters talk about similar things. At the very beginning of the book, we see what the whole book will be like and will accomplish. The first appeal (an appeal to Paternal) is that we need not join the greedy and unjust, but we are to listen to our elders and not disobey them. Like it says in Proverbs 1:8-9, “Hear, my son, your father’s instruction, and forsake not your mother’s teaching, for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck”. Next is the first appeal of Wisdom,it starts at 1:20, “Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice; at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks”. It keeps going until the end of the chapter, where the second appeal of paternal starts. There are ten appeals to paternal and 2 appeals to wisdom between chapters 1-9. The rest of the book talks about similar things as the first part of the book.

The book of Proverbs came after the covenant with David because the book was written around the time when Soloman was king and after. The book of Proverbs is referenced/quoted a few times in the NT, like Proverbs 3:34 in James 4:6 which says, “But he gives more grace. Therefore, it says, God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble”. As well as Proverbs 10:12 in James 5:20, Proverbs 24:12 in Matthew 16:27, and Proverbs 25:21 in Romans 12:20. Jesus is also connected to the book of Proverbs because he is in everything, everywhere. He is above all and knows all. He loves us and dies for us. So in every book of the bible we are anticipating his coming, dieing, and resurrection, even if it does not tell us, we know a bigger picture but not THE big picture that only God, Son, and the Holy Spirit know. The book of Proverbs is a book of wisdom that was given to the writers from God, and in the Trinity Jesus as well. So in conclusion, Jesus along with God and the Holy Spirit are in every book of the Bible. how else would it be so coherent as a whole? And finally, we should not turn from God for he knows all, but we should obey him and his commands throughout the Bible.

We Should do what the book of Proverbs commands us to do. We should be like the people Proverbs talks highly about, but we should not be like the people that are doing the complete opposite. Like in the book of Psalms, there is a lot of wisdom that we should believe in and take to our hearts. Since some people think the king Soloman wrote or collected the book of Proverbs we should not do what he did, when he used his knowledge for evil, had many wives, and worshiped many false gods.
