One may ask, What is Justice? Justice is an idea and practice that should punish the wrong and not the right. This is going to be proven by two things, one of which is the Bible and the other <i>The Republic</i> by Plato. First, this paper will discuss what <i>The Republic</i> says about Justice and then the Bible and conclude that is as close to the ultimate justice (God himself) one can get in a short period.
In the beginning of <i>The Republic</i>, the group of men in the house of Polemarchus were discussing whether or not money helped with age and being just. According to Cephalus, having money helps one do right because they have the money to pay their debts and for their pleasure; but the question is, happiness; does every rich person do this? The answer is no because if they have money, then they want more because they think it will bring happiness, but lo-and-behold it brings pain and suffering. So… does money make one just?

Next is the “Allegory of the Cave”. First, one needs to know what it is and where it is found. The Allegory of the cave is found in the very beginning of book VII of <i>The Republic</i>. Plato first starts by saying that humanity is like humans in a jail chained to the wall that can only see the shadows of an item that is cast on the way by the light of a fire they can not see or know exists. Like it says in.

> <p class="no-indent">Behold! human beings living in a underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets (The Philosophers, pg. 265 <i>The Republic</i> book VII).

<p class="no-indent">Later in book VII, one prisoner escapes and sees the Overworld. They see that everything they have seen in the prisons was a shadow and fake. But when he comes back to the prisons and tells the others, they do not believe him and think he is crazy,,. They so they kill him (Plato, <i>The Republic</i> book VII).

Next, how is this connected to justice? The main reason that comes to mind is the question, is it just to kill someone just because you do not believe what they are saying is true? Or do you think they are crazy? No, it is not just to do so; but, it is unjust although many think otherwise, saying that they killed Jesus on the cross two thousand years ago. He was the one that knew about the shadows and no one believed him. Another reason it could be true knowledge everyone wants it and thinks they have it, so when someone tells them they are wrong and that everything they ever knew was fake, they would not like that guy and would want to get rid of him. Like Jesus, he was offering new knowledge that everyone did not want, so they killed him.

Now, what does the Bible say about Justice? In the first five books of the Bible there are a lot of laws for the people of God to follow, and if they do not there would be consequences, this is first shown when they do not obey God and have to wander for 40 years. And is again shown when Babylon takes over Israel for 70 years. Some may say that God was unjust for doing this, but is he when he told his people that he would do it if they turned from him? 

Does God define ultimate justice? God is very just, like it says in Psalms 11:7 “For the LORD is righteous, he loves justice; the upright will see his face”. God “loves justice” not the justice which one may think of that is not real justice because it is fallen and corrupted unlike. God’s justice which is pure, holy, and forgiving. His justice would send us all to Hell if he was not forgiving, compassionate, and loving.

Is Justice just what one thinks is right and what is wrong? Yes, and No. Justice is what God says it is, but no one really knows what that is exactly, therefore humans make laws to be followed. But everyone tries to guess what it is and fails over and over, therefore many people have been served unjustly. So then is justice what the state says it is? On earth it is if one does not follow what the state says, then there will be consequences, but in heaven God has the power and defines Justice.

In conclusion, Justice is tricky, but is carried out by the state on Earth in our attempt at Justice. God holds the ultimate justice and man can not know what that is fully, only grasp a small part of it. As in the thesis statement, “Justice is an idea and practice that should punish the wrong and not the right”. Justice is a practice that can, but always as one can see in the courts today, punish the wrong and not the right.
