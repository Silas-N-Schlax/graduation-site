Christian humanism restricts personal or individual freedoms, by requiring Christians to set aside self-indulgences in earthly things, put Christ as the only goal in life and worship him, and to seek the invisible. Humans are living rational beings with the power to think and to change their lives by their own actions, whether those be good or bad. Christians believe that everything is “predestined” by God yet they still have the ability to reason and choose, and that God has continual care and love for them. Humans only have 1 life to live, why should we live it with all sorts of regulations and rules? Like the monks who followed the Benedictine rule, which as William and Joseph state, “Benedict united all his monks before God eight times a day in the liturgical prayer of the divine office” (<i>The Case</i>, pg. 111). They spent all day working, praying, and giving themselves up to God instead of doing what they wanted using their individual freedoms.

Augustine says, “Begin then to praise now, if thou intendest to praise for ever. . . . Praise and bless the Lord thy God every single day, so that when the time of single days has passed, and there has come that one day without end, thou mayest go from praise to praise, as ‘from strength to strength’” (<i>The Case</i>, pg 110). Augustine tells his readers to “Praise and bless the Lord thy God every single day” but why do that when you can praise him forever in heaven? Things like indulging in self pleasures, worshiping something else, or seeking the visible are sins for Christians, but it also restricts what they can do. In conclusion, Christian Humanism does restrict personal freedoms, by not allowing for things that are considered sinful, such as seeking the visible, indulging in self pleasure, and not worshiping the Lord.
