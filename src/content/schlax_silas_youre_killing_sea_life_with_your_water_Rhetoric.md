I have a question for you; do you enjoy the beach, or watching dolphins swimming while you are on a boat, or snorkeling in a coral reef? These three things are great wonders given to us, and we have a responsibility to take ownership over them and preserve them for the generations to come. Beaches, Coral reef’s, and marine habitats are not the only things us humans are destroying, but they are the ones I am going to focus on for this speech. Without a change, we will be responsible for the deaths of millions of marine life in our lifetimes, while we can’t stop that, we can reduce the number. One last question before we dive in, do you want to be responsible for the death of dolphins?

How is my takeout coffee consumption or one time use water bottle usage harming marine life? Great question, did you know that only 35% of all American’s recycle? The rest of the population just throws their empty plastic cups or bottles away, or in some cases leaves them places. Out of all the plastic bottles, and cups that the entire world uses about 9 million metric tons ends up in the ocean every year, yes every year! That is equivalent to 3.288 million Cyber Trucks, or over 750,000 School buses. Every time you throw away that coffee cup, think about this, your cup could end up in the ocean, or worse killing a dolphin. Over 300,000 dolphins, porpoises, and small whales are killed each year due to plastic and fishing gear in the ocean, and your cup could be one that deals the fatal blow to one of these precious lives. You know, one of those cups or bottles that you threw away, might have already. Now let’s assume that your bottle ends up in the ocean, and does not kill marine life–at least not yet–after some time it will end up in The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which for your reference is twice as large as Texas and three times larger than the entire country of France. This island collects millions of tons of trash and plastic each year, we are not doing much about it, besides Rwanda which was the first nation in the world to ban all non-reusable plastic items. Rwanda has also established a nationwide trash cleanup every week, cutting down on trash left in the environment, allowing fewer animals to suffer from our account. In order for your conscious to be clean, you must recycle all your plastics, in order that we might try to cut down the amount of plastic ending up in the ocean, and killing Marine life, destroying Coral Reefs, and polluting beaches.

Do you want to be responsible for the deaths of possibly hundreds of dolphins? Do you want to, do you want to aid in the increased size of The Great Pacific Garbage Patch? If the answer to both of those is yes, then there is something wrong with you, but if your answer is no, then recycle! Yes, recycling can help to reduce the amount of plastics in the ocean each year, allowing less Marine life to suffer at our hands. Don’t have the death of a dolphin on your hands, recycle your plastics today!
