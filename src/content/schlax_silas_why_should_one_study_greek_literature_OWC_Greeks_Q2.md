Because people study Greek writings, one can, therefore, become more engaged in what the Greeks believed and that can help one’s imaginations to know a little more about what God is like and not like. This paper will compare and contrast the differences between the Greek gods and the Christian God. Then the paper will prove that by studying Greek literature (the Greek gods), one can better know what God is like and not like, or in other words, one would know more of his attributes.

First, who is God? God is the King of kings, Lord of lords, All-mighty Father, Prince of peace, all-knowing, all-powerful, etc. Now for some things that God is not; sinful, corrupted, greedy, a thief, etc. God is the one and only, the builder of everything like it said in Hebrews 3:4, “For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God”(Hebrews 3:4 ESV). One can see these in everything around them from the computer with this paper to the food for dinner, but Romans 1:20, tells it better. “For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse” (Romans 1:20 ESV). 

Second, who were the Greek gods? The Greek gods were the false gods of the time of the Greeks. The Greeks thought everything needed a god, from music to the birds of the air. Some of their attributes are sin, corruption, envy, greed, murder, and jealousy. They thought they could do whatever they wanted, and so on. One thing the Greek gods are not all-powerful, all-mighty, and all-knowing. This can be proven in many ways, but that is for later in the paper. The Greek gods are all in all lazy, corrupted, jealous, and greedy.

Third, does God or the Greek gods keep promises? God has kept all the promises that he has made. Like his promise to Israelites that they would be in Babylon for 70 years before returning to Israel, this promise came true, but one may ask why were they in Babylon in the first place, didn’t God promise them he would protect them? Well, yes, but they had to not worship false gods or break his commandments, which they did. Another is the promise of Jesus in the very first book of the bible. God promised these hundreds of generations before Jesus was born, but he still came and crushed the head of the devil. But the Greek gods do not always keep their promises, just like humans. For instance, Poseidon promised his son the cyclops that he would avenge him by killing Odysseus, but in the end, Odysseus ends up surviving and gets back home to his family.

Fourth, are the Greek gods more powerful than God? The answer to this question is NO!!! First, think about how God tells the Israelites that if they do not obey his commandments, he will take away their blessing and curse them instead. But the Greek Gods can not do this like when Apollo gave the gift of prophecy to Cassandra, he could not take it away but he instead made it so no one would ever listen to her ever again. Another is when the Israelites were fighting other nations when they were on their way to the promised land as long as Moses had his hand lifted they would win, and later when David was fighting wars for Saul if David did what God told him to do he would win. But the Greek gods do not have this power at all. Like in the <i>Iliad</i>, Zeus had promised Achilles’ mother that he would make the Trojans win for a while, but when Hera (Zeus’s wife) came and made him sleep, the Greeks won. In conclusion, God does not get distracted and is all-powerful, but the Greek gods can hardly keep control and are relatively powerless.

Fifth, are the Greek gods all-knowing like God? The quick and short answer to this is no. This is because if the Greek gods were all-knowing, then why can they be deceived, tricked, and killed? This is simply because they are not all-knowing like God is. If they were, then Zeus would not have been tricked by Hara into sleeping, or when Poseidon was helping the Greeks in the Trojan war and Zeus didn’t know for a while. In conclusion, if the Greek gods were all-knowing, then they would know everything as God does. He knows every thought, every act good or bad, right or wrong, what has moved and what has not, and he knows this before it even happens. He knew it before everything even came to be.

The sixth and final topic is, Why are there so many Greek gods and only one Christian God? First, one question, if there are so many Greek gods, then why can they not do as much as one all mighty God? One reason is the Greek gods are a myth and not real. Another is they are all corrupted, greedy, murderous, and sinful. They are all horrible rotten people that supposedly have supernatural powers such as immortality, prophecy, control of land, air, water, fire, etc… So in conclusion the Greek gods are horrible rotten people that are so numerous that no one can keep them in order.

Finally, the conclusion where everything is tied together in just a few sentences. In conclusion, the Greek gods are horrible rotten, supposedly supernatural beings, that are powerless, not all-knowing, can’t give and take, and for Christians, only help is in knowing what God is like and not like. Now for the one thing that this paper was for. If one looks at what the Greek gods did, couldn’t do, and how rotten and corrupt, one can then compare that to the Bible. By doing this, one can then see that God is not like those Greek gods at all in how he is almighty, all-powerful, all-knowing, and created everything. God is 3 in 1 but not many (like the Greek gods were) he is not the Greek gods of any other god either he is the one True God. So, in conclusion, by looking at what the Greek gods are like, one can then have a better idea of what God is like.
