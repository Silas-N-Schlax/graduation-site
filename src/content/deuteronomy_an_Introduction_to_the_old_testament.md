Moses wrote the book of Deuteronomy. He most likely wrote it ~1406 B.C (ESV study Bible page 363). this book is a book of Law yet again. 

In the part that was read Deuteronomy 4-8, 10-11, and 28-30, it starts out with Moses giving commands of obedience to the nation of Israel. Then in chapter 5-6, Moses gives the ten commandments and the greatest commandments again to the nation of Israel. Then Moses reminds the nation of Israel that they are the chosen people. Soon after Moses tells the people not to forget the Lord you God as it says in Deuteronomy 8:11, “Take care lest you forget the LORD your God by not keeping his commandments and his rules and his statutes, which I command you today”. But if they do not obey the Lord, then they would surely perish like the nations the Lord makes perish to them. He will do to the nation of Israel. In chapter 10, Moses goes back up into the mountain and the Lord gives Moses new tablets with the ten commandments. In chapter 28 Moses tells the Nation of Israel all the blessings the Lord will give them if they obey the Lord. but in chapter. But he also gives the curses if they disobey the Lord. like in Deuteronomy 28:15 “But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD your God or be careful to do all his commandments and his statutes that I command you today, then all these curses shall come upon you and overtake you”. And finally, in chapter 30, the Lord tells the nation if they disobey him that they need to repent and ask for forgiveness.

The book of Deuteronomy would only fall right after the covenant with Moses/Israel. In Mark 12:29-32 it talks about Jesus telling the scribes that there is the Lord our God and no other and then the scribes agree with him saying, “And the scribe said to him, “You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him”. This is related to what Moses said in Deuteronomy 4:35 “To you it was shown that you might know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides him”. Another time Deuteronomy is referenced in the NT is in Matthew 22:37-38 where the Pharisees ask Jesus what the greatest commandment is and he responds with Deuteronomy 6:5 then he tells them that the second is that we should love our neighbor as ourselves. Romans 10:6-8 and Deuteronomy 30:11-14 are both saying that the word of God is not far off in Heaven or in the sea but in their months and in their hearts. One of many verses Jesus quotes is Deuteronomy 6:16 in Matthew 4:7 “Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, You shall not put the Lord your God to the test” (https://biblebits.me/).

We should do what Moses tells the nation of Israel in Deuteronomy 6:5 “you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might”. We should also be like what Moses tells the nation of Israel to do or they will be kicked out of the land the Lord had given them. We shouldn’t be like the nations that Israel destroyed, because they worshiped false gods, and broke many, if not all, of the 10 commandments.
