Augustine found God because he would not stop searching for the truth till he found it, which God used to draw him closer. This paper will discuss how Augustine found God and became a Christian. One will also read about what Augustine did with his new faith, and what he thought of his own past action.

Augustine was born with a Christian mother and a pagan father. He was given a pagan education because his mother thought it would help him become a Christian, although his father wanted Augustine to have great fame and honor. Augustine was a rebellious teen and young adult, and tried as hard as he could to avoid his mother’s faith, believing he would never become a Christian. Despite Augustine’s beliefs, Monica, who was Augustine’s mother, prayed day and night that Augustine would become a Christian.

Augustine believed categories and terms that different philosophers like Aristotle made could explain everything, and tried to understand and learn about God by describing and categorizing him with human terms. But God is not a human, human terms can not describe him.

Augustine searched for the truth, never being satisfied with what he had, trying to find the truth and prove everything. It was not until then when he really read the Bible that he finally understood that he did not have to prove everything. God says we do not have to prove everything for them to be true. In John 20:29 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.” 

After a long time of searching and learning, Augustine finally realized that he wanted to become a Christian, but did not want to make the commitment. He writes in his Confessions,

> <p class="no-indent"> So was I speaking and weeping in the most bitter contrition of my heart, when, lo! I heard from a neighbouring house a voice, as of boy or girl, I know not, chanting, and oft repeating, “Take up and read; Take up and read.” Instantly, my countenance altered, I began to think most intently whether children were wont in any kind of play to sing such words: nor could I remember ever to have heard the like. So checking the torrent of my tears, I arose; interpreting it to be no other than a command from God to open the book, and read the first chapter I should find. For I had heard of Antony, that coming in during the reading of the Gospel, he received the admonition, as if what was being read was spoken to him: Go, sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come and follow me: and by such oracle he was forthwith converted unto Thee. Eagerly then I returned to the place where Alypius was sitting; for there had I laid the volume of the Apostle when I arose thence. I seized, opened, and in silence read that section on which my eyes first fell: Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, in concupiscence. No further would I read; nor needed I: for instantly at the end of this sentence, by a light as it were of serenity infused into my heart, all the darkness of doubt vanished away (Augustine, 309).</p>

<p class="no-indent">This was the moment that Augustine took up the Bible and read. This was the moment he accepted Christ and the Holy Spirit. After this great moment in Augustine’s life, he went straight to his mother to tell her he was a Christian. When his mother found out, she leaped for joy and triumph.</p>

After Augustine’s great conversion, he sought to follow Christ by stopping teaching philosophy to pagans, and instead put his efforts into writing and proving that Christians did not cause the fall of Rome. Augustine used his pagan education to preach to pagan people, using their religion as examples or to show how God is the true and only God. Augustine also helps the Church with his thoughts and writings.

In Confessions, Augustine writes about events in his life before he became a Christian. “Yet I lusted to thieve, and did it, compelled by no hunger, nor poverty, but through a cloyedness of well-doing, and a pamperedness of iniquity. For I stole that, of which I had enough, and much better. Nor cared I to enjoy what I stole, but joyed in the theft and sin itself.” (Augustine, 207). Augustine says that he stole the pear not for its substance, nor its beauty, but only to sin. Before Augustine found God, he was an obstinate, rebellious, and sinful man. This is the reason he wrote the book confession in the first place to show how he failed to seek God when he was younger.

Augustine needed the path he took, from being an obstinate, rebellious, and sinful man, to searching everywhere for the truth. After years and years of praying day and night, Monica’s prayers were finally answered, God brought Augustine to him. No matter how far one may be from God, he is never too far for God to find. Augustine found God because he would not stop searching for the truth till he found it, which God used to draw him closer.
