1 Samuel has an unknown writer, but some think that Samuel or one of his deciles might have written some documents that were later put into a book (ESV Study Bible, pg 545). The book of 1 Samuel was most likely written in the late tenth century B.C. 1 Samuel is a book of historical narrative.

1 Samuel starts out with a woman that had never had a child praying out to the Lord asking him for a child and that if he gives her one that she would give him back to the lord. The lord then blesses her with a son who she named Samuel. When Samuel was old and learning the ways of a priest from Eli, God spoke to him about Eli and that he was going to destroy them for what Eli’s sons had done. Then Israel was being attacked, and they brought the ark of the covenant. Because of this, Eli’s sons and many others died. When Eli heard of this, he fell over and broke his neck, dying there. Once they get the ark back, they demand that Samuel give them a give to rule over them. He asked God what to do. He told him to give them their king. Later, a man by the name of Saul was searching for his father's lost sheep and came upon Samuel. Now God had told Samuel the day before that a young man was going to come to him and that he was to anoint him king over Israel that day. Saul wins many wars when he is king, but eventually, he turns from God, doing what was evil. So God rebuked him as king. Soon after, Samuel anoints David to be king. Now David found the sight in the Lord and defeated many enemies for Saul and made friends with Saul’s son, Jonathon. When Saul found out that David was to be king, he wanted to kill him, so he tried many times. So David fled to foreign lands and ran for a long time. The book ends with Saul dying at war.


The book of 1 Samuel is right before God made his covenant with David. From the reading and research I have done, I can not find any verse from 1 Samuel that is quoted in the NT. But I know that 1 Samuel is referenced in a way whenever the genealogy of Jesus is written, because this is how David became king and right before God’s covenant with David. The book of 1 Samuel does not have many direct references or quotes in the NT. Jesus doesn’t really talk about 1 Samuel because it is like a slow movie where it starts out with backstory or flashbacks for the main character's past or childhood. Then 2 Samuel is when we get to the middle of the movie and action starts and the covenant with David is made.

Everyone should be like David when Saul was chasing him. He had the chance to kill Saul 2 times but instead he felt guilty for cutting Saul’s robe. We should believe that God will turn his back on us if we turn from him like he did to Saul when he did what was evil. We should be like David in the way that he believed that God was all ways by his side, and he could do anything with his help, which was true because he killed a lion with his bare hands and Goliath with a stone.
