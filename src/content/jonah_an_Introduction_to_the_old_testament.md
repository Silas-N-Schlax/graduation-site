The book of Jonah was written by an unknown author. Jonah was written somewhere between the middle 8th century B.C and the end of the third century B.C. the book of Jonah is the fifth minor prophet out of twelve (all info from ESV study Bible pages 1811-1814).

The book of Jonah starts out with God telling Jonah to go to Nineveh, but Jonah did not want to because they were known to be killers and he did not think they needed to be saved. So Jonah got on a boot with pagan sailors. But God did not like this so he sent a huge storm to come and destroy the ship if Jonah did not jump off the boat. So the sailors throw him off and a huge fish at him. In those three days Jonah prayed and prayed, and prayed until the fish spit him out on a shore near Nineveh. While he was in the “Big Fish” Jonah had confessed his sins and God had forgiven him. But then came the hard part, Jonah had to enter Nineveh. When he did he told the people that they needed to repent or God was going to set the whole city on fire, which is what Jonah wanted. When the day came round Jonah was sitting on a hill under a plant God had grown waiting for him to destroy the city. But what he did not know is that the whole of Nineveh had repented and God was no longer going to destroy it so he got mad at God for it so God made a worm eat throughout the plant and kill it. That is most of the book, the rest is where Jonah gets really mad to the point he wants to die.

The book of Jonah is after the Babylon captivity but before the birth, death, and resurrection of Christ. The book of Jonah is not quoted in the New Testament but is referenced in Matthew 12:40 when Jesus is asked to see a sign. “For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, aso will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth”. This is almost right from Jonah 1:17 “And the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights”. This is telling us that Jonah foreshadowed that Jesus was going to die and spend three days and three nights in the dark abandoned. Then come back at the end of the third night, like it says in Hebrews 1:3 “He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high”. 

We should not do what Jonah did in turning from God, and we should never run for him either. But if we do since we are the fallen human race we need to repent like Jonah did, maybe not in the belly of a whale, but you get the point. We should also believe this really happened. We should also be like Jonah is the way that he went to Nineveh and told the people to repent, this is kind of like what missionaries do today.
