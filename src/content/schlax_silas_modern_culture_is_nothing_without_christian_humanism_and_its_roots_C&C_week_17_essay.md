Christian Humanism without recognizing its roots in Western Culture has no benefit to Christian Humanists but hinders them in their exploration and recovery of Christian Humanism. Christian Humanism has been built upon the Christian Faith, but also has deep roots in Western Culture. As <i>Jens Zimmermann</i> said, “Unfortunately, many Christians share in this forgetfulness, and thus fail to guard and cultivate the roots of Western culture that are necessary for current social revitalization” (<i>Jens Zimmermann</i> 2012, 22). These roots are necessary for Christian Humanists to recover both Christian Humanism and the old culture in the twenty-first century.

Without recognizing these roots, the culture ends up asking questions like “Who are we and what are we here for?” (<i>Jens Zimmermann</i> 2012, 21), and either will not answer them or answer them in a way that does away with God. These roots allow the culture to continue forward together in a way that does not inherently dehumanize the culture. But once the culture does away with this way of thinking and traditions and makes its own new “revolutionary” ideas, they end up in a death spiral doomed to fail.

Humans are inventive and sometimes brilliant beings, but these attributes often lead to untruthful ideas or practices. One solution to this would be to introduce these old ideas and practices into the culture, especially to the young. This looks like a difficult task because it is, the culture today has completely rejected most of the ideas that Christian Humanism proposes, thus making Humanists jobs a lot harder. But with patience, prayer, and dedication, Christian Humanists can make a difference in the dark. In conclusion, roots in western culture are necessary to recover the old culture, and Humanists must work hard to put these ideas back out in this secular culture.
