Moses wrote Exodus, most likely around 1446 B.C. The book of Exodus is a book of Law or otherwise known as the “Torah”. 

The book of Exodus starts when the Pharaoh of Egypt sees Israel was enormous and he didn’t want them to revolt and take over Egypt so he enslaved all the Israelites. But even under the enslavement, the Israelites keep growing in numbers. So Pharaoh said that every first-born son was to be killed. This is where Moses comes in as a first-born son. His mother does not want Moses to be thrown into the Nile, so she makes a basket and puts the child in it. Then the princess finds the baby and has his mother take care of him until he is 2. Moses grows up as the brother of Pharaoh. But one day when he is out in the wild, God comes to him in the form of a burning bush. He tells Moses to take the Israelites out of Egypt. But Pharo won't let him so God sends 10 plagues to Egypt. After the son of pharaoh is killed, he lets the Israelites leave. Then leave as soon as possible, taking everything with them. Next, they cross the red sea on dry ground and wander in the wilderness for a while. But in Exodus 20 God gives Moses the “Ten Commandments. Through chapter 25-31 God tells Moses how to build the Tabernacle. In chapter 31, God gives Moses the tables that he then breaks when he sees that the Israelites have built a golden cow. After God Gives Moses new tablets, the Israelites build the Tabernacle and everything in it. Then Moses blesses Aron and his sons as the Priests of Israel. 


The book of Exodus would really only fall in one place in salvation history and that would be the covenant with Moses/Israel. In Matthew 15 1-9 Jesus is telling the pharisees and scribes that we need to honor our fathers and mothers, and not to do what the pharisees and scribes were telling everyone to do, “But you say, If anyone tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is given to God, 1 6 he need not honor his father” (Matthew 15-5-6). In this passage Jesus is talking about Exodus 20:12 “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you”. Another is in Mark 12:29-31 which talks about the greatest commandment. Jesus says that the greatest commandment is to love the LORD your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. And the second is to love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus is talking about Exodus 20:3-7, 16-17. One Prophecy is in Exodus 12:46 prophecies that no bones will be broken. And in John 19:33-36, John tells us that they didn’t break Jesus’s bones (like they usually do) but only pierced his side.


We should do what the 10 commandments say to do .Without the 10 commandments we would have no true right and wrong that we are to obey. We shouldn’t be like the Israelites when they made the golden calf and worshiped it, making God and Moses furious. We should be like Moses and be faithful to the Lord our God even in our hardest trials like in James 1:2-4 where he tells us to “count it all joy” and “let steadfastness have its full effect”.
