> <p class="no-indent">Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why such a large part of mankind gladly remain minors all their lives, long after nature has freed them from external guidance. They are the reasons why it is so easy for others to set themselves up as guardians. It is so comfortable to be a minor. If I have a book that thinks for me, a pastor who acts as my conscience, a physician who prescribes my diet, and so on--then I have no need to exert myself. I have no need to think, if only I can pay; others will take care of that disagreeable business for me.</p>

Truth, the one thing all mankind throughout the history of the world has attempted to obtain, yet there is not one universal idea of this premise. All have asked the age-old question; what is truth, and how can I obtain it? Yet, somehow, history has many interpretations and answers to this question, from the Bible, to Milton, or Descartes to Shakespeare. Some say truth has to be revealed, while others say one can reason to find it. But which brings ones to truth, is it just one? A combination of both? Or something completely different? While God is the ultimate truth revealed through the Bible, authors like Descartes, Hume, and Kant argue that only reason can move one to truth, whereas others like Burke, Milton, Pope, Shakespeare, and Tocqueville, argue—at least in part—for a creator or divine orderer to have given us all knowledge, stating that one must use reason to interpret it.

While there are many interpretations, for this age-old question, the Bible gives an ultimate answer for those to believe. The Bible teaches that truth is revealed to us from his word, as John says, “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’” The truth John is talking about here is the word of God, as Timothy says, “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.” Thus, God’s word is the truth that is revealed to us through the Bible, it is revealed both through the words, and the Holy Spirit, or revelation. With the Bible as the ultimate truth, how do non-biblical authors from the Enlightenment period differ or agree?
