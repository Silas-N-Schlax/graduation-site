The book of Daniel was Daniel himself in the sixth century B.C. The book of Daniel is a book of history (all info from ESV study Bible pages  1701 - 1704). 

The book of Daniel starts out with the whole of Israel being taken over and Daniel and his fridges taken into exile to Babylon. Then, as it says in Daniel 1:7 “And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego” they all got new names. But soon the king had a dream that no one could interpret until Daniel was summoned and God told him the interpretation in the night. After Daniel interrupts the dream, Nebuchadnezzar promost Daniel. Unfortunately, soon after Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego would not bow down to a golden idol so the king cast them into a fiery furnace, but as most know they did not die but survived with their clothes unburnt or the smell of fire. Then one of the most famous is Daniel in the lion's den. Although I have run out of words so… the second half of the book is not history like the first half but has a lot of dreams instead.


The book of Daniel is mostly during the Babylon captivity. Daniel is quoted many times in the new testament mostly in Matthew and Mark and a few in Luke. on is Daniel 9:27 “And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week,7 and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator.” This is quoted in Matthew 24:15. One prophecy that Jesus fulfills is that in Daniel 2:44, which says; “And in the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever” this is fulfilled in Luke 1:33 and Hebrews 1:8-12. Another is that Jesus will bring an end to sin in Daniel 9:24. Which Jesus fulfills in Galatians 1:3-5 "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen." Other ways that we can connect Jesus to Daniel could be through the fiery furnace. Some think that the 4th figure in the fire was the son of god, if not Jesus still would have been in that situation in sending an angel of something to save Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.


We should believe that this happened and that we might also have troubles we will have to face for our faith. Like Daniel had to when he was sent to the lion's den. We should also try to be like Daniel and not forsaking God even when he knows he might die for it. We should also believe that God has the power to rise up and tear down like all the kings in Babylon.
