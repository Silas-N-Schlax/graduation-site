No one knows who wrote Nehemiah, but it is most likely the same person who wrote Ezra. The book was probably written around 445 B.C. The book of Nehemiah is a book of narrative history.

The book of Nehemiah starts when Nehemiah gets a report for Judah. He asks the king about it and the king grants him to go and rebuild the temple and the wall. The king also gives Nehemiah with money to build and free passage on his way. Then they start to rebuild that wall, but some people do not want the wall to be rebuilt because they think they will revolt. Soon Nehemiah hears that there are people coming to destroy them, so he has everyone carry a sword and only use the left hand to work so that if anyone comes to attack them, they will be ready. 
> <p class="no-indent">“From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail. And the leaders stood behind the whole house of Judah, who were building on the wall. Those who carried burdens were loaded in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and held is weapon with the other” (Nehemiah 4:16-17).</p>

<p class="no-indent">After the wall is rebuilt, they have a great celebration and a time of teaching for the Bible. During this time, Israel repents confessing their sins. The rest of the book is about how Nehemiah gets everything back in order. The book ends with Nehemiah’s final regards, telling everyone what to do according to the law of Moses.</p>

The book of Nehemiah is after the covenant with David and the Babylonian captivity, but before Christ. The book of Nehemiah is yet again one of the few books not quoted, referenced, or have prophecies (that I know of). But Jesus is sort of connected to this book because he is a part of everything. As Christians, we are called to live lives that honor, worship, and give glory to God. Nehemiah was doing this by rebuilding the city of Jerusalem and its wall. He was also doing this by reminding Israel that they are to obey God like it says in 1 Corinthians 10:31 ESV “So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God”. Nehemiah was doing this all the time he helped the poor from their oppressors and stopped the breaking on the sabbath. One of the key themes is that worship should be at the center of every christian life. Like John 4:24 ESV says; “God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth”. Or Luke 4:8 ESV “And Jesus answered him, It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.”

We should be like Nehemiah in that way that he did what God told him to do. We should not be like the people trying to stop Nehemiah from rebuilding the wall. We should not be like the people who were oppressing the poor. We are yo do what the bible says to d o and not turn from our ways. And finally we are to believe that this actually happened.
