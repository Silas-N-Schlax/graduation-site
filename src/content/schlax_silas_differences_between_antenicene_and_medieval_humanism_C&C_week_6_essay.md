Ante-Nicene Humanism focuses more on the Bible and Christ’s resurrection while Medieval Christian Humanism focuses on both faith and reason and the pursuit of intellect. Ante-Nicene Humanism and Medieval Christian Humanism are both rooted in God’s word, but in the Medieval era the pursuit of intellect and reason became a prominent practice, and used the Bible and old texts from Aristotle, Plato, and others. Ante-Nicene Humanists and Medieval Christian Humanism are both influenced by the pagan writings. For the Ante-Nicene pagans are all around, and there is a big present influence, but for Medieval Christian Humanists pagan influence had died down with the rise of the Church, and for them the manuscripts from authors like Aristotle caused problems when studying the Bible. “The more one knew of Aristotle, the more challenging biblical study became” (Readings, pg. 141 <i>The Middle Ages</i>). 

Ante-Nicene didn’t study much pagan writings, they focused on the Bible, but the Medieval Humanists even with the warning from Augustine studied secular writings and teachings separate from the Bible. This led to many problems including Medieval Humanists greatest Triumph; “to make God seem human” (Readings, pg. 140 <i>The Middle Ages</i>). One large difference between the Ante-Nicene Humanists and Medieval Humanists is that the Medieval Humanists started to explore the order of nature and science, unlike the Ante-Nicene Humanists which pursued the nature of God through the Bible. One Similarity between both Medieval and Ante-Nicene Humanists is that they had this view of himself as lesser than God, unlike the modern view. C.S. Lewis has a great example in The Discarded Image, He says that the Medieval worldview sees them at the bottom of the stairs and God at the top, but the complete opposite is true today.
