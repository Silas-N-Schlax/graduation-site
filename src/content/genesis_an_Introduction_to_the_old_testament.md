Moses wrote the book Genesis. He most likely wrote Genesis somewhere between 1446 B.C - 1406 B.C (<a target='_blank' href="https://www.biblica.com/resources/
scholar-notes/niv-study-bible/intro-to-genesis/">NIV study bible</a>). Genesis is a book of law. 

Genesis starts with God creating the world and everything in it, including humans. Then Adam and Eve ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and brought sin upon the world. God then cursed Eve’s offspring and the ground on which Adam had to plant food. The longer humans were on earth, the worse the sin got, so God had Noah build a huge ark that would take 2 of every kind and Noah and his wife and his sons and his son’s wives. So God flooded the earth, killing everything that dwelled on land except Noah and his family and 2 of every kind. There are many generations, then we get to Jacab and his 12 sons. Out of the 12 sons, Joseph was Jacab’s favorite. Now Joseph’s brothers didn’t like this, so they planned to kill him and blame it on a wild animal. But instead they sold him into slavery. The lord blessed Joseph and put him in charge of Potiphar’s household. But they put him in jail for something he didn’t do. But God blessed him there as well. Soon Pharaoh called him to interpret a dream, when Joseph told Pharaoh what the dreams ment, he put Joseph in second in command of all the land of Egypt. So Joseph did his job and eventually his brothers were at his feet, begging for food. Finally, Joseph went home and brought his family to Egypt to help with Pharaoh's flocks. At the end of Genesis, Joseph and his family bury their father where Jacab’s father was buried.

This book would fall in many places in the beginning part of the salvation history timeline. To name a few, you would have Creation, the Fall, The promises of Redemption, and finally the covenant with Abraham. In John 8, we see a scene where Jesus is tempted to sin by Satin like Adam and Eve did in the first couple of chapters in Genesis. But instead Jesus doesn’t sin, but responds with other OT references. In Matthew 19 Jesus refers to the Creation of male and female and how they are supposed to come together as one flesh just as God had made female out of male they are one flesh (<a target='_blank' href="https://www.csmedia1.com/317ministries.net/new-testament-references-to-genesis-1.pdf">Dr. Eddie Bhawanie page 2</a>). Jesus fulfills this prophecy in Genesis 3:15 “I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.” This is telling us that Satan will bruise Eve’s offspring and Eve's offspring (Jesus) will bruise his head and eventually end him on the last day.

We should believe in creation because, without it, we would not be here today. Another reason we should believe in the Creation is that it points us to our creator and to what he made. We should also believe in sin and how bad it is, and that humans created it. We shouldn’t be like the people who were trying to build the Tower of Babel as they were trying to get to Heaven. We should be like joseph and how he forgave in brothers for selling him in to slavery. Now we shouldn't be like his brothers and sell our siblings into slavery.
