Christian Humanism is the message of Christianity that emphasizes Christ coming unto the world and God’s continual care and love for us. Christian Humanism as an idea dates back to around the Renaissance period, and has recently been uncovered as a resource for Christian Believers, the Church, and in the world for Christians to use. Christian Humanism today plays a large role in making the world more human in the face of opinions that are anti-God, and  anti-Christian that are trying to dehumanize the world. Christian HumanismHuminasm is constantly opposed in collegescolleges,  on social media, and in the general community; , but, unfortunately, the voice of Christian Humanism is oftenoften ignored. When we ignore Christian Humanism as many do today we gain problems in the culture, like abortion, gender-confusion-confusion, racism—— and these are only a few problemsproblems we face in the world today.
	
Christian Humanism focuses on the affirmation of human life and culture and is derived from the Bible and the Christian Faith;; where as, secular humanism focusesfocuses only on the human aspect through science, and opposes God and the Christian Faith. On page 24 of Readings in Christian Humanism,, the authorthe author says “Humanism is an attitude centering in human interestsinterests or values..” AndAnd to summarize what N.F.S. Grundtvig, and John Locke said, we are humans first than Christians, but when we become Christians, God does not “unmake” us, we remainremain human. In conclusion Christian Humanism is what it means to be human, through the lens of the Christian Faith, even through current opposition Christian Humanism does not fail, but often prevails over secular humanism.
