The Bible never tells us who wrote the book of Ruth, but many suspect that Samuel wrote Ruth. The book was most likely written any time after 1010 B.C. This book is of History (ESV‌ ‌study‌ ‌Bible‌ ‌page‌ ‌534).

The book of Ruth starts with Naomi (Ruth Step-Mother) Widowed. Then Naomi travels back to the land of Judah. But Naomi told her daughters-in-law to return to their father's house, but Ruth didn’t return but told Naomi this; Ruth 1:16-18

> <p class="no-indent">But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. 17 Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the LORD do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you.” 18 And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.</p>

<p class="no-indent">After that, Naomi let Ruth come with her. When they return, Ruth goes to a field to get grain after the reapers pick the crops. But a man named Boaz saw her and told his reapers to secretly leave grain for her to glean. Boaz all invites her for lunch along with the reapers and sends her home with some leftovers for her mother-in-law. Eventually, Naomi tells Ruth to go to Boaz and, when he goes to sleep, to uncover his feet and sleep by them. In the morning, Boaz gives her six measures of barley. Then Boaz redeems Ruth after she asks. The book ends after Boaz and Ruth marry and the writer gives the genealogy of David.</p>

The book of Ruth Would probably fall right before the covenant with David since Ruth is in the genealogy of King David. In the book of Ruth, I see no quotes in the New Testament. And from what I have researched, it is one of the few books that is not quoted in the New testament. So now I will talk about how the book of Ruth points to Jesus. From what I have seen, the book of Ruth points to Jesus, mainly because Ruth is in the genealogy of David, who is in the genealogy of Jesus. Another is that a son is said to be born in Bethlehem at the end of Ruth 4:11.

> <p class="no-indent">Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman, who is coming into your house, like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you act worthily in Ephrathah and be renowned in Bethlehem.</p>
    
<p class="no-indent">Which is then fulfilled when Jesus is born in a stable in the small town of Bethlehem one night.</p>

We should be like Ruth in that she obeys her mother and elders like we are told to do in Deuteronomy, “Honor thy father and mother”, Ruth does what her mother tells her to do and what Boaz tells her to do. We should be like Boaz as he was kind to everyone in the book of Ruth. Another way the Boaz is a model is that he helped the people that need help Like Ruth when he had his reapers drop some of the food for Ruth to pick up for her and her mother to eat.
