“Adventure and riches await any swashbuckler brave enough to take the helm and command a fleet. Wage war against rival captains. Build and upgrade your ships with masts and cannons to increase speed and firepower. Conquer islands and exploit the land to gain valuable resources. Navigate dangerous waters and avoid the ever-wandering storm.” (Plunder; <i>A Pirate’s Life</i> Rule Book, p.g. 1). Today, I will be teaching you how to play the game of Plunder; A Pirate's Life.

Firstly, what is Plunder; <i>A Pirate’s Life</i>? Simply put, it is a board game that combines the aspects of Settlers of Catan, Risk, and Scythe, but adding new mechanics to create a new unique game. From ravaging the costs of islands, to trading with fellow pirate, or maybe you are a little evil and want to attack everything that moves! This game allows for all sorts of players to gather and pretend they are those fearless, mostly drunk, sailors you remember from childhood! Are you ready to begin this adventure? 

Before we can start, we need to set up the board. To create a very playable game, the board is created with 6 double-sided tiles with a grid of six-by-six. Shuffle these tiles and place them at random inside the outline to create a new and fresh board. To the side of the board you will place the resource cards–Rum, Iron, Wood, and Gold, separate 10 of each and place face up off to the side, then shuffle the rest and place face down. Next to these cards, you will place the Plunder Point and the Treasure Cards shuffled. Finally place the two compass spinners, X-Marks-The-Spot tokens, the three dice, and the Storm piece near the board. Finally give all the players their three ships, six flags, and reference cards. 

Now that we have the board setup, we should get our ships sailing! But first we need to place the X tokens and the storm, spin the compasses and put the tokens and storm where it indicates. To pick the first player either see who can act more like a pirate, or role a die, the highest roller goes first. The first person picks one of the six islands that ONLY have one skull, and places their flag on the island, and their ship on the anchor symbols–the port. Continue clockwise till everyone has placed their flag and ship. Every then draws 3 resource cards from the top of the deck. Now you are all set to start the game!

But what can you do on your turn? To start, you pick 1 addition resource card for each flag you have, then roll the white die. You can then do one or more of the following actions:
- Move
- Attack an island or enemy ship
- Conduct a trade
- Hunt for treasure
- Upgrade your ship
- End your turn, passing the dice to the next player

Let’s say that you pick to move your ship, and you rolled a 3, you can move your ship up to 3 tiles from your current location as long as you follow these 3 simple rules; you cannot move through islands or other ships, you cannot move diagonally, and you cannot move into or out of the storm without paying 2 resource cards from your hand. For each mast your ship has it can move 1 addition tile for free. 

What about trading and upgrading? First trading, unlike in Catan you can not always trade with the bank, you have to be in a merchant port which there are only 4 of. When in this type of port, you can trade two-to-one for any resource in the bank. Now you can trade with other players too, but only if you are in a merchant port, if someone else is in a merchant port, if you are next to their ship, if you are in their port, or they are in your port. Remember that you can only trade on your turn. Now what about those fancy upgrades? Well, it's quite simple, refer to your reference guild to see the materials needed to buy that item, then if you have the materials place them in the bank and take what you bought and place it on one of your ships, on the board, or next to you, respectively. Note that Cannons and Masts do not take effect until your next turn. 

Finally, treasure cards!!! Treasure cards can either give great rewards, or great penalties, you get them by moving to a tile with an X on it, then you will spin the compasses to place it somewhere else and pick the top card from the deck reading it aloud. You must complete the task/penalty to get the reword, and follow all the instructions on the card, here is an example.

Now that we got the basic mechanics down, what about eliminating your opponents?! Well, first you must be next to their ship or in their port to attack them, and no, diagonals don’t count! Before you attack them, you can threaten them, demanding resources for free or for a major profit on your end. Here is an example; Bob, I am going to attack you unless you give me 3 gold! Bob can either give me the gold creating a treaty, or refuse. But let's say that I don’t threaten Bob, Bob now has the option to bribe me, giving me some resources to not attack, if I take this bribe a treaty is created. Before we move onto actual attacking mechanics, if you trade with a player, take a bribe, or seceded in threatening, you cannot attack that play that turn, you are in a treaty, but treaties only last for that turn. Ok finally, when you want to attack someone you both role a die, for this example I have a ship with one cannon and Bob doesn’t. Bob rolls a 3 and I roll a 2, I win because my cannon counts as an extra point and ties always go to the attacker. Now let's say I was attacking his island, that had one skull, I would lose because for each skull on an island adds one point to their role. If you have zero lives left after an attack, your ship is destroyed and the other player gains a plunder point, unless stated otherwise.

Ok, you can play the game, but how do you win? The basic objective is to gain plunder points, 10 to be exact. You might remember the plunder point cards I was talking about earlier, but those are not the only way to have them. In fact, each one of your ships on the board, and captured islands also count for one point each. A few ways to gain plunder point cards are from buying them (5 gold), destroying ships, or getting them from treasure cards. As soon as someone reached 10 plunder points, the game ends, with them as the winner!

Finally, here are a few rules you must know to play. First, if all your island’s ports are inside the storm, you do not collect your one resource for that island on your turn. Second, the storm is moved when someone rolls a one, in which case you spin the compasses and place it where they tell you to. Third, when you re-spin for the X tokens if it lands back on you or next to you, you are allowed to collect it if you have the right amount of moves left. 

Now you are set to begin your pillaging expedition of a lifetime, but are you ready? “Are you ruthless enough to prevail? Do you seek gold and infamy? If ruling the seas is your ambition, it’s time to unleash your inner pirate. It’s time to plunder!” (Plunder; <i>A Pirate’s Life</i> Rule Book, p.g. 1).
