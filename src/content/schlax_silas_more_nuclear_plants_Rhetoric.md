Nuclear Fission, it's truly a wonderful feat for mankind, but as many global warming activists are trying to argue, “It's harming nature by warming earth”! While I will leave the playing with highly reactive elements to the professionals, I ask you this. How come? To the uninformed eye, Nuclear energy seems like a dangerous process, but isn’t the same true for most other forms of “clean energy”? Common conceptions of “clean energy or fuel” includes; wind, solar, tidal, hydroelectric, bio, and hydrogen. But are any of these truly safe and clean? Is there such a thing as a clean energy source? With the power shortages across the United States, and the world, something needs to be done, I propose the increase of Nuclear energy.

As I asked before, is there truly a safe and clean energy source? In short, no. But by common definition, which states; A clean energy source is any energy that does not put pollutants–greenhouse gasses–in the air, we could rule out every energy source right there. This is due to the mass amounts of fossil fuels used to build all these methods, from mining, to building structures. But if we only look at the perspective of energy production we can find some “clean” sources; wind, solar, tidal, hydroelectric, bio, and hydrogen. 

Okay, these are “clean” but are they practical? Let’s start with Bio-fuels; Biofuels are made using corn and other grown crops. All the crops needed for making these fuels could instead be used to feed those in need, over making an inefficient fuel that does not work with most motors. Next, Tidal, the first reason that it's impractical, as there are very few places in the world where these can be set up, and once the energy is collected, it is hard to get it back to land. Wind, while there are many places in the world where we can set these up, it is hard to get the energy from the windmills to people, as you can’t build around them. Solar, while solar is a fairly good energy source during the day, it takes up a lot of space to make sufficient energy. Its only practical use is for residential homes and small businesses. Hydroelectric is one of the few good sources once constructed, as generally it is built near(ish) cities and doubles as a water pumping facility. Hydrogen is THE best replacement for fossil fuels, as it is renewable, no emissions, and is more efficient. While all these energy sources have their downsides, as does Nuclear, I will prove next, that Nuclear is superior by far to most of these so-called “clean energy sources.”

Is Nuclear energy safe? Simply put, yes, but the reason might surprise you. The large reason that Nuclear energy is safe is because of you. Yes you, or more specifically the working class. When Nuclear energy was first made instructional, the public was scared–as they should have been. This quickly led to thousands of safeguards and plant house redesigns. In the history of Nuclear energy only a handful have melted down and exploded, 2 due to natural disaster, and the others the negligence of the Russian government, I don’t think I need to explain the last one further. Most of the minor incidents were 100% contained within the facility. The fact is, Nuclear energy is safe to use, as plants release about 0.01 millirem of radiation per year, which is 1 thirty thousandth the amount that every human is exposed to from nature and other man-made products every year. Compared to the radiation of coal plants, which is over 190 times more produced yearly. The final reasons that Nuclear energy is the way to go is the Nuclear energy is sustainable, it runs 24/7 always at 100%, they can be build super close to cities, so there is less energy loss, and the Nuclear plants produce 5.1 billion kWh per year for an average size plant–which is about enough power to run 1/42 of all the lights in the United States.

There are those who would say that Nuclear is expensive, limited, and harmful to nature. While yes Nuclear energy is limited as Uranium is non-renewable, by the time we run out, we will either have a way to make stable Uranium, or have a better alternative–Cold Fusion. As for harmfulness to nature, Nuclear power plants are always built on or near a river to get water to cool the reactor. The water that is taken in always comes out cleaner without chemicals in it. The land reserves of power plants are also a no hunting zone, allowing other animals to live, without harm from humans and zero effects from the plant. Price is a little hard to explain so I will take an average Nuclear power plant, and a Wind turbine. A Nuclear power plant costs ~$9 Billion to make, with an annual cost of $20 million for refueling and maintenance. A wind turbine cost $4 million to build with a $48,000 annual maintenance cost. You might look at this and think, yeah Nuclear is expensive. But what you miss is 2 key points. First is that wind turbines are not always running, and second, 1 turbine produces a fraction of the energy a nuclear plant does. Without going into the math, it would take ~8,500 wind turbines to produce the same amount of power a Nuclear plant does, which would cost $34 Billion, with an annual maintenance cost of $408 million. Still think Nuclear is worse? 

If you are still not convinced, what about the life expectancy of Nuclear plants vs wind turbines? On average, a nuclear plant is operated for 60–80 years, while a wind turbine only lasts about 20 years. Nuclear Fusion is not only safe, but it is a solution to our energy problems, and is cheaper than other energy sources. Nuclear Energy is not of the future, nor the past, but it is of the present. Atomic bombs cause mass destruction, but Nuclear energy builds communities, feeds our electrical needs, and is “clean” in the process. While it's not a solution forever, it is a solution now, let us set aside our opinions about energy, and use the most effective source, so that we can put our energy into working together to create something better for the future. 
In conclusion, Nuclear energy is not something to be feared, and dismantled, but should be built and used with the intentions to create safe, reliable, and affordable energy.



# Math for those interested
```javascript
Nuclear Plant = $9 billion / 5.1 billion kWh per year : + $20 million per year
1 Nuclear : 8500 Wind
Wind turbine = $4 million / 6 million kWh per year : + $48,000 per year
8500x Wind turbine = $34 billion / 5.1 billion kWh per year

To produce 5.1 billion kWh per year:
- Nuclear Initial = $9 billion
  + Yearly cost = $20 million
- Wind Turbine = $34 billion
  + Yearly cost = $408 million
