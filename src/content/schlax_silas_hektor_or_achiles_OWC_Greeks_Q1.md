Between Hektor and Achilles, Hektor is better at being a hero. Hektor is a better hero because he sacrifices his life in the end for his country, even though he knows he will die. While Achilles is being a baby, angry at Agamemnon over his war prize. Now look at this argument to see why Hektor is the better of Achilles.

First, the <i>Iliad</i> states that the book is about the anger and devastation of Achilles and why he would not fight. 

> <p class="no-indent">Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus’ son Achilleus and its devastation, which put pains thousandfold upon Achaians, hurled in their multitudes to the house of Hades strong souls of heroes, but gave their bodies to be the delicate feasting of dogs, of all birds, and the will of Zeus was accomplished since that time when first there stood in division of conflict Atreus’ son the lord of men and brilliant Achilleus (Homer, <i><i>Iliad</i></i>, book 1 lines 1-7 page 75).</p>

<p class="no-indent">It also shows how much Achilles is a big adult baby, who just sits there watching his friends fight and die because he is angry at one man. Achilles only fought after his best friend died at the hands of Hektor. As his anger increases, he continues to pursue Hektor, chasing him around Troy three times (Homer, <i>Iliad</i>, book 22). We also see that Achilles’ anger is only satisfied when Priam, the king of Troy, comes pleading at his feet for the body of Hektor, the noble hero of Troy. Achilles' anger is finally settled when the king of Troy, Priam, comes pleading at his feet like a peasant to his king asking for his great and honorable hero, Hektor. He also tells Achilles about his father and how he is just like Priam, weak, feeble, and old.</p>

Second, look at Hektor and what he did in the book. One of the first scenes Hektor is in when he is inside the walls of Troy talking to his wife, Andromache. Andromache is begging him to not fight so that she will not be left a widow and their son left fatherless. But Hektor tells Andromache he has to fight so he won’t be a coward like his brother. Next, the book shifts to Hektor dominating the battlefield and destroying the Achaians. Soon Achilles sends Patroklos as him to rally the troops so they might push the Trojans off, but Hektor kills Patroklos, making Achilles angrier. When Hektor is killed by Achilles, he dies for his country. This is one reason Hektor is the better hero.

Third, look at why Hektor is the better hero. The first reason that comes to mind is that the Achaians were outnumbered the Trojans. Even with this disadvantage, more damage was inflicted on the Achaians. This shows Hektor as a great warrior, having courage to fight both Achilles and the Achaians. Even in the Bible, this stays true that when people have God and courage, they can do anything. Examples include David and Goliath, the escape from Egypt, and Battle of Jericho. Even though they were outnumbered, Hektor and the Trojans were better, even if they lost in the end.

Fourthly, early in the <i>Iliad</i>, we see why Achilles is not a great hero. In book one, we see Achilles and Agamemnon fighting over a girl. This shows immaturity on the part of both Achilles and Agamemnon. Because of this, Achilles decides he will not fight for the Achaians until they come to his ships. Later in book 9 of the <i>Iliad</i> Agamemnon sends a group of men to Achilles’s shelter to win him over with gifts beyond measure. But Achilles says the same thing as before that he will not fight until they come to his ships. This shows us that Achilles is so angry over a girl that he will let his friends die for it. Therefore, Achilles is a big baby and not a better hero than Hektor.

Fifthly, in book 16 of the <i>Iliad</i>, Hektor kills Patroclus making Achilles mad because Patroclus is his best friend (Homer, <i>Iliad</i>, book 16). This shows how Achilles is still a baby and immature. After all, he will only fight the Trojans because he is madder at them than Agamemnon. Being mad at Hektor, he is no longer as mad at Agamemnon. In book 22 of the <i>Iliad</i>, Achilles is still so mad at Hektor that he chased him around Troy three times before killing him (Homer, <i>Iliad</i>, book 22). This is similar to the story in 2 Samuel, where Saul and his army are chasing David and his few companions around the desert. This also shows that small groups win if they have God and courage, like in both David and Saul and the Trojans and Achaians. One difference between these two stories is that Achilles kills Hektor in the end. David, however, does not kill Saul even though he had many opportunities. Going back to book 22 in the <i>Iliad</i>, Achilles at this point becomes desperate (Homer, <i>Iliad</i>, book 22). He is so angry that he kills anyone in his way of killing Hektor.

Sixthly, would Hektor have been a hero if the war never happened? The war was started by his brother Paris when he stole Menelaus’s wife Helen. After Paris took Helen, Menelaus then called all the men who took the vow to not take Helen and would fight for her if needed. If the Trojan war did not happen, Hektor would not be a hero from this war. But another war may allow heroism to prevail along with avoiding death for both Hektor and Achilles. 

Now look back at paragraph 2. In this paragraph, it looks at who Achilles is and how he is a big baby. In the block quote in the second paragraph we see that the book is about Achilles' anger and devastation. This leads him to being a big baby because he won't fight for the Achaians but wants the Trojans to win for a bit. In paragraph 3, however, it talks about who Hektor is and why he is not a baby like Achilles. In conclusion, Hektor is the better hero because Achilles is just being a big baby.
