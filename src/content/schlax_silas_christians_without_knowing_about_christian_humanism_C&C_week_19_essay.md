I had never heard or knew what the term “Christian Humanism” was before attending this class. Now that I know what it is, I can see how I have seen it taught or used in my past, but it was always called something else. Even now that I am looking for the term people don’t call it Christian Humanism, I think this is due to something we talked about earlier this year, that being that the term “humanism” has been secularized and Christians tend to avoid it all together. But even if Christians avoid the term, they are still practicing Christian Humanism, even if it's just a little. I see this in my friend group at church, we often talk about the effects secularism has on our culture and Christianity, and things we can do to stop it, but avoid the term “humanism” –at least before I started this class–and instead called it something like “The Christian Duty” or “What can we do?”. 

But even Christians tend to imitate the culture around them, I think Grundtvig points to this in the beginning of the section we read. He is pointing out the difference between man and animals is words and speech, as an animal can imitate humans in acts but not words and speech. I think this can be applied to culture in the way the Christians tend to imitate some things of culture without even realizing it, but have to realize that we have a great gift from God and that we don’t need these earthly pleasures. I see this a lot when talking with friends. Even when we are joking or making fun of our culture, we bring in these ideas and toss them around like they mean nothing, when in reality they mean a lot and we must analyze them carefully. Christian Humanism is a difficult topic, and more so when you try to apply it, but it is essential to positively affect our culture, even a little.
