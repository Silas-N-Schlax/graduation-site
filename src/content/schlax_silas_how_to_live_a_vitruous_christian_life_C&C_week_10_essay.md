To live a virtuous Christian life, one must know that Christ is the true virtue, heartily acting upon his promises, and making him the only goal in life. In Erasmus second chapter of his letter <i>Handbook of a Militant Christian</i> he gives 6 rules for living a Virtuous Christian Life. His first and most important rule is that a Christian must “place great reliance on the Scriptures” (<i>Readings</i>, pg. 271). Scriptures are God’s own words as it says in 2 Timothy 3:16, “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.” Erasmus says that mankind tends to think of heaven and hell as a legend or myth. But Christians must put reliance on the Scriptures and trust that God speaks the truth. The second rule is that Christians must act upon Christ's promises “With the resolute purpose we must be prepared to undergo loss of everything–poverty, life itself–for Christ’s sake” (<i>Readings</i>, pg. 272). You must have endurance to not turn back from the trials and persecution, James 1:2 says, “Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds.” 

The third rule is to “analyze these unfounded fears; when we do, we find that they are not as bad as they appear” (<i>Readings</i>, pg. 274-275). Erasmus says that the main stumbling block in the pursuit of virtue is fear itself, Christians must overcome these fears to become virtues and live their life for Christ. The fourth rule is that Christ must be the only goal in life, to live for him and to glorify him in everything you do. Like it says in 1 Corinthians 10:31, “So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.” The fifth rule is that Christians must turn away from the visible things and seek the invisible, or God himself. Erasmus says that Christians neglect the invisible world like the pagans, but in fact Christians are in both the visible and invisible world. The Sixth and final rule states that in order to be holy and virtuous Chrstians must search the “sole archetype of godliness, Christ Himself” (<i>Readings</i>, pg. 289). For no man can teach virtue unless he is trained in it, Christ is the teacher and the Bible the textbook. In conclusion, to be a virtuous Christian, one must rely on the Scriptures, act upon his promises, overcome their fears, live life for Christ only, seek the invisible, and look to Christ for true virtue and holiness.
