The book of Psalms was written by many authors, one of which was king David. The book was written somewhere between the 9th and 5th centuries B.C. Psalms is a book of wisdom (all information from ESV study bible pg 1047-1053).

The book of Psalms is split into 5 books: book 1 chapters 1-4,1 book 2 chapters 42-72, book 3 chapters 73-89, book 4 chapters 90-106, and book 5 chapters 107-150. (ESV study bible pg 1054). One of the main topic and how a lot of the Psalms start out is that of submitting yourself before God pleading for him to turn his ear to you, like in Psalms 5:1 “Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning”. Another theme is that of praying and worshiping God. Many times in Psalms, it talks about this topic like in Psalms 145:1-2 “I will extol you, my God and King, and bless your name forever and ever. Every day I will bless you and praise your name forever and ever”. The book of Psalms is also one of the few books in the bible that I know of that we sing from. This is because it is a book of hymns, praises, rejoicing, prayer, and WORSHIP. David is one of the main writers in the beginning and then towards the end he just disappears.

The book of Psalms came before the covenant with David because some of the Psalms David wrote and sung to Saul when he was king. Many NT books reference the book of Psalms; a few are Psalms 2:1 in Acts 4:25-26, Psalms 6:3 in John 12:27, and Psalms 14:1-3 in Romans 3:10-12 (ESV study bible footnotes og 1055-1239). Psalm 22:22 says, “I will tell of your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you”. And Hebrews 2:12 quotes this saying, “I will tell of your name to my brothers in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.” Jesus fulfilled the prophecies that his own will reject him in John 1:11 from Psalms 69:8 “I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother’s sons.” In Psalm 78:2-4 it is prophesied that Jesus will speak in parables which he does many times in the Gospel. Another way the relate Jesus to Psalms would be the fact that he quoted in often like in Psalms 8:2 “Out of the mouth of babies and infants, you have established strength because of your foes, to still the enemy and the avenger”. Jesus quotes at the end of Matthew 21:16. Another way that we could connect Jesus to the book of Psalms could be through David. Since David is in the lineage of Jesus and he wrote a good portion of Psalms, this would be a fairly good way to connect him. And the final way to connect him to Psalms is that he is above everything and in control. He knows all just like the Father.

In a way, we should do everything that the psalmist’s tell us to do. And not do what they tell us not to do. We should therefore also believe what they tell us about God, Son, and Spirit, how we should act, and pray to God. and we should be like all the psalmist's and how they pray, worship, and extol God.
