# Easter Egg Challenge

I have hidden nine easter eggs throughout this website, each will give you a part of what you need to find the tenth and final easter egg! Because some of these are hard, every Monday and Friday, I will give out one clue, that is till I run of out clues to give! The way clues will work is the following. On Monday you will get a page to look at, a url will be provided, this just tells you hey, something is here find it! Then on Friday I will give you what you are looking for, but never tell you what exactly it is. For reference point 1 will be for easter egg one, 2 for easter egg 2 and so on.

I will let you know that each clue will be one or two words, never more. And each one will also tell you a number (1-9), this will help you later! First person to find all the clues and fill out the form you will find at the end will be crowned champion! If they so wish will get there name put somewhere on this page (Location TBD).

### Clues (Hints): 
<i>There may be a two week delay while I am traveling, but I will try my best!</i>
